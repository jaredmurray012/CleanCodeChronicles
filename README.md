# CleanCodeTechniques
The goal of this repository is to practice using the concepts that are found in the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

Goal 1, Improving Variables and Functions 

Robert C. Martin, in his book, Clean Code, advocates that a variable name should make three key points. First a variable name should explain to us why it exists. Secondly a variable name should also express to us what it does, and finally how it is used.

When it comes to functions Mr. Martin recommends the following two points. A function should be short, and a function should only do one thing.

The goal with the following files I commit to this project are to encompass these two principles. Also to include other Clean Code principles as I learn them in his book Clean Code. My goal is to improve my craftsmanship as a programmer when I code, to make my code as readable as possible to any other person that comes across it.
