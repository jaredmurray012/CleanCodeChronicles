This is the README For LetUsDoMath

This is a little mostly dumb, kind of smart calculator application made to practice 
Clean Code Techniques. Aptly named the Clean Code Chronicles. This is part one. 

THE PREAMBLE 

The two topics that am I focusing on are good Variable names and small Functions. 

Variables should express three things: Why this variable exist, what does it do, and 
how it is used. Functions on the other hand are meant to be SHORT and focus on 
ONE THING. 

Those are the over-arching goals of this program. I choose to do a "calculator" app
because it was the first idea that popped into my head and I decided that consistent
coding is more important to me than making some elaborate project. 

APPLICATION DETAILS 

The goal of this application is to display a small variety of options to the user 
and allow the user to select an option and proceed to solve a math equation using 
prompts from the application. Also there intends to be a decent amount of user 
validation so that the end user does not crash the program. Though the program 
may exit depending on input.
